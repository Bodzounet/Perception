# Perception
A puzzle game for the Oculus Rift

This game was creating during the my first semester at keimyung University.
There was no bounds in this class, we were free to create whatever we wanted.
Since the lab owned an Oculus Rift, we decided to try it and make a game base on it.

Perception uses the Oculus as mush as possible, and most of the puzzle mechanics are based on the use of this device. For example, the direction where the player looks or the way he nods may be required to open a door.

In addition of the Oculus, we had a three color system in the game : when swapping the color, some elements may appear or disappear, or just behave differently.

During the developpement of Perception, we mainly focused on the mechanics and the technical part of the game, and so there is a lack of level design.

Levels are hard to progress through, and a tutorial would have been nice. Yet with a bit of perseverance, it is possible to go through all the levels.
